Note: Due to the left-click button, you must first access the Alpha Layer with the left thumb before accessing the Number Layer with the right thumb.

## Combos  

The image below will be improved in due time. Currently, the labels for the mode combos only refer to the underlying numbers associated with each mode. A new user will have to try the combos out to see what mode a given combo switches to.
